SOC 2 is a framework for managing customer data based on five trust service criteria: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

Organizations must implement access controls, encryption, incident response plans, and monitoring systems to comply with SOC 2.

SOC 2 requires data retention policies to align with legal and contractual obligations. Audit trails and logs must be maintained for accountability.

All user access must be reviewed quarterly to ensure proper privilege assignment. Changes to production systems must follow a documented change management policy.

Service providers are expected to maintain business continuity and disaster recovery procedures.

SOC 2 requires that service organizations implement logging and monitoring to detect unauthorized system activity. Logs must be retained and reviewed regularly.

All production deployments must follow a documented change management procedure, including approvals and rollback planning.

Employees with access to customer data must undergo background checks and annual security training.

Vulnerability management must include periodic scans and timely patching based on risk level.

Encryption keys used for protecting data must be rotated regularly and stored securely using a key management system (KMS).
