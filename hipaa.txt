The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires covered entities and business associates to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Protected Health Information (PHI).

HIPAA mandates that PHI be stored securely and only accessible to authorized personnel. Physical and electronic safeguards must be implemented.

The HIPAA Security Rule requires encryption of ePHI at rest and in transit. Audit logs must be enabled and regularly reviewed.

HIPAA requires healthcare records to be retained for at least six years. Any access to PHI must be logged, and patients must be notified in case of a breach.

Annual HIPAA training is mandatory for all employees handling PHI.

Covered entities must designate a HIPAA Privacy Officer and a HIPAA Security Officer responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable rules.

Mobile devices containing PHI must be encrypted and protected with strong passwords or biometrics.

Workforce members must report any suspected or confirmed unauthorized access to PHI within 24 hours.

HIPAA allows patients to request access to their medical records and receive an electronic copy within 30 days.

Role-based access control (RBAC) must be enforced to ensure minimum necessary access to PHI.
