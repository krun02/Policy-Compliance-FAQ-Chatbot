NIST SP 800-53 provides a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls for federal information systems and organizations.

NIST recommends implementing continuous monitoring to detect threats and anomalies. Controls include access management, risk assessment, and incident response.

Organizations must develop a system security plan (SSP), define roles and responsibilities, and conduct regular control assessments.

Data must be classified and labeled according to its sensitivity. Secure disposal procedures must be followed for obsolete systems or media.

All system changes must be documented and reviewed under a formal change control process. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for privileged accounts.

NIST recommends using configuration baselines to ensure consistent security settings across systems. These baselines must be reviewed and updated regularly.

Security awareness and training must be provided to all users with access to organizational systems and information.

Organizations should implement an Incident Response Plan (IRP) that defines roles, communication channels, containment strategies, and recovery procedures.

All high-impact systems must undergo annual penetration testing as part of ongoing risk assessments.

Backup and recovery procedures must be tested periodically to ensure system availability and resilience.
